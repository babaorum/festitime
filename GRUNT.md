GRUNT INSTALL
=============

To install grunt and is component, you just have to run the following command :

`$sudo npm install`

Once everything is installed, to use grunt, you must open a new terminal, go to the project folder and run the following command :

`$grunt watch`

The purpose of this command is to wait that you modify any js or less file, to mignify it.
When you pull changes, you will have to make a change in one file and save it to let grunt do his job.
